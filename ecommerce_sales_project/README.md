# E-Commerce Sales Project

This project is built using Snowflake to analyze e-commerce sales data. It includes:

- Creating tables for customers, products, and sales
- Loading data from CSV files
- Writing SQL queries to analyze sales performance

The goal is to gain insights such as:
- Total revenue
- Top-selling products
- Monthly sales trends
- Customer purchasing behavior

The project uses Snowflake SQL and sample data files stored in the `data/` folder.
